          <p>
            I wanted to do something special for your 20th birthday and because i'm not physically there with you,  
            I made a birthday letter for you. I hope you like it.  
        </p>

        <p>
            I know we have been a bit distant lately, but I want you to know that I Love You with all my heart and soul.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want you to know that you are very Precious and Important to me, don't you ever forget that okay. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <br>I miss you sooooooooo much, and I am really really sorry for all the times you were hurt or upset because of me.
          <br> <br>I am very greateful for all the things you've done for me and for all the times you were there for me.
          </p>

        <p>
          I was doing my college project and I was thinking what to do for your birthday and then i came up with this
           website idea. <br> There is nothing i want more than to have you back. I know i'm not perfect but i am trying 
           to be better for you. <br> I don't wanna loose you Rohitt, I Love You more than anything and everyone. 
        </p>

        <p> 
          I know i've told you this before but i can't help it. It's you on mind 24/7, like literally.
          <br> You know just talking to you makes my crappy day so much better. Idk how to explain but something about you 
          is just so... <br>You are an amazing, amazing human being and my fav tbh. You make me the happiest on earth 
          without even trying.
        </p>

        <p > 
          You know how stars shine at night, all those pretty stars shine for you,my love.You are a superstar your self,
          again my fav.

        </p>

        <p> Your eyes are magical. Remember when we were in your area's garden and you told me there's a spark in my 
          eyes and i said "really? I don't see it". But you know I do see it.
        <br>Every moment that we shared together are my favs, all of them. You do make me feel at home and you do make feel 
        safe.You know i could be the moon and you could be the earth because my whole world revolves around you.  
      </p>
      <p>
        You know whenever i drive scooty, I imagine you sitting back and hugging like that time we did when i just learned
        to drive.<br<br>>My most favourite memory of us is, when you were at my place and you were laying on my lap, at peace 
        and looking just soooo adorable. I wanna go back to all the times we spent together and take the courage and
        tell you all the things I now wish i had when you were with me. 
      </p>
      <p><br><br>
        Rohitt, I just wanna see you happy and safe. I wanna make you happy but lately all i'm doing is hurting you and 
        it's killing me inside knowing you were hurt because of me.
      </p>
      <p><br><br>
        You are all i want and all i need. You are my universe (it might be cringe to you ig but that's the truth)
        I really really Love you and all i want is best for you. I might be the luckiest to have you by my side, i mean it's YOU.
      </p>
      <p><br><br>
        I would like to write a poem for you (not my words but i do feel the same )
        <br> On this day of your twenty years so true,<br>
        My heart sings with joy, my love for you.
        <br> Each moment shared, a precious gem so bright,
        <br> In your presence, my world feels right.
        <br><br> As time unfolds, I hope we get better.
        <br> with all my love, Happy Birthday to the the biggest superstar.
        <br> ~ From your biggest fan.
